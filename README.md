# Fake Twitter Frontend

This template is designed for developing a Vue 3 frontend application in Vite, specifically for the Fake Twitter project.

## Recommended IDE Setup

For an optimal development experience, the following setup is recommended:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension for Vue 3 support in VSCode (Make sure to disable Vetur).
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) for enhanced TypeScript support.

## Customize Configuration

For customizing the Vite configuration:

- Refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command in your terminal to install all necessary dependencies:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```

2. **Compile and Hot-Reload for Development:**
   - To start the development server with hot-reload feature, use:
     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```
   - This will serve the application, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Compile and Minify for Production:**
   - To build the application for production, use:
     ```sh
     npm run build
     ```
   - This compiles and minifies the application for optimal performance in production.

## Integration with Fake Twitter Backend

Ensure that the backend service (`fake_twitter_backend`) is running as per the instructions in its [README.md](https://github.com/zawad1992/fake_twitter_backend/blob/master/README.md). This frontend application is designed to interact with that backend, so proper integration is key for full functionality. Follow the guidelines in the backend README to set up and run the backend service effectively. This will ensure that the frontend and backend components of the Fake Twitter project are seamlessly integrated.


## Additional Notes

- Ensure your development environment meets the requirements for running a Vue 3 application.
- Regularly update your dependencies to keep the application secure and efficient.
